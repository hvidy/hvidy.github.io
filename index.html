    <p>My research has found me at the intersection of the fields of asteroseismology and long-baseline optical
      interferometry. These are two of the most powerful techniques of modern stellar astrophysics,
      made possible due to recent advances in instrumentation. I have made use of data provided by
      the NASA Space Telescopes <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html" class="nav2"><i>Kepler</i></a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite" class="nav2">TESS</a> to study stellar oscillations and used the PAVO instrument at
      the <a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/" class="nav2">CHARA</a> interferometric array on Mt Wilson, California to precisely determine the parameters of
      several Kepler stars. By studying the oscillations of stars asteroseismically, and measuring angular
      diameters with interferometry, fundamental stellar parameters such as mass, radius, and effective
      temperature may be determined with great precision and accuracy. Determining these constraints
      is crucial for testing stellar models, through which we understand stellar structure and evolution.

    <h4 class="head"> January 27 2015: An ancient extrasolar system with five sub-Earth-size planets</h4>
    <p>Today we announce the discovery of a system of five planets around the star Kepler 444. Using asteroseismology, we have measured the age of the star to be 11.2 billion years, making this the oldest system of terrestial-sized planets yet discovered.<p>

    <p> The five planets have sizes between those of Mercury and Venus, and all orbit the star in less than 10 days. Although Kepler 444 is smaller and cooler than the Sun, the planets orbit so close that liquid water can not exist on their surface. Nevertheless, the existence of these planets suggests the existence of other ancient Earth-sized planets, some of which may have been able to support life, even this early in the Universe.</p>

    <p> The study, led by Tiago Campante from the Unversity of Birmingham, is being published online today in <i> <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/799/2/170/article" class="nav2">The Astrophysical Journal</a></i>, and a preprint of the accepted paper is available on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06227" class="nav2">arXiv</a>. </p>

    <h4 class="head"> July 2014: Paper Accepted!</h4>
    <p> My collegues and I have just had a paper accepted by <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. 
      The paper, titled <i>The Physical Parameters of the Retired A Star HD185351</i> was led by John Johnson, a professor at Harvard University. 
    </p>
    <p>
      'Retired A stars' are the name that has been given to evolved stars that were once A-type stars when they were on the main-sequence, 
      burning hydrogen in their core. They have a mass between ~1.5 and 2 times that of the Sun. The key result of John's PhD thesis was 
      that he found a number of planets around these stars, and the occurance rate of these planets has important implications for planet 
      formation models. There has been discussion in the literature about whether these stars really are retired A stars, and not of a 
      lower mass. James Lloyd at Cornell has advanced the argument that since higher mass stars evolve more rapidly these stars will be 
      very rare, and any unaccounted systematic errors between spectroscopic parameters and models could account for these apparently high-mass stars.
    </p>
       <p>
      In this paper we report on observations of HD185351. The spectroscopy and models indicate that this star should be a retired A star, 
      but is it? We analysed <i>Kepler</i> observations of HD185351 to determine the mean density and surface gravity of the star with 
      asteroseismology, and measured its diameter interferometrically using the PAVO and Classic instruments at the CHARA array. With these
      different measurements, we were able to directly measure the mass of HD185351. While there is still some disagreement between the different methods,
      all masses are consistent with HD185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 times that of the Sun. HD185351 was an A star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this is just one star, and there's more to be done with measurements of other stars to resolve the question over the existance or otherwise of 
      retired A stars. Nevertheless this case highlights well the usefulness and complementarity of asteroseismology and interferometry for directly 
      determining stellar parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A preprint of the accepted paper is available on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2329" class="nav2">arXiv</a>, and John has a more detailed discussion
      of our result at his <a href="http://mahalonottrash.blogspot.com/2014/07/ringing-stars-that-are-this-big.html" class="nav2">blog</a>.
